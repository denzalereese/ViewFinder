  <h1>Viewfinder Community Guidelines</h1>
  <h3>Please Do These</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Play Nice</h4>
      <p>
        We're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Only upload content that you have created.</h4>
      <p>
        Respect the copyright of others. This means don't steal photos or videos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own. (That's what favorites and galleries are for.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Moderate your content.</h4>
      <p>
        All content on ViewFinder, public and private, has to be appropriately moderated as "safe", "moderate", or "restricted" using our safety and content filters. If your judgment proves to be poor, we'll moderate your account to match appropriate categorization for Safe Search and/or content type and send you a warning.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Link back to ViewFinder when you post your ViewFinder content elsewhere.</h4>
      <p>
        ViewFinder makes it possible to post content hosted on ViewFinder to other web sites. Pages on other web sites that display content hosted on ViewFinder.com must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on ViewFinder. This provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Enjoy ViewFinder!</h4>
      <p>
        This is your community. Celebrate your creativity, be social and share what's important to you. See the world through others' eyes, participate, find your muse, and expand your horizons!

  <h3>Please Don't Do These</h3>
  <p>
    Here's the deal: We like to give second chances. However, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean deleting your account with or without warning.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't upload anything that isn't yours.</h4>
      <p>
        This includes other people's photos, video, and/or stuff you've copied or collected from around the Internet. Accounts that consist primarily of such collections may be deleted at any time. ViewFinder also has a zero tolerance policy towards sharing adult or sexualized content of another person without that person’s consent (Non-Consensual Pornography). If you experience this, report it to us.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't forget the children.</h4>
      <p>
        If you would hesitate to show your photos or videos to a child, your family, or a stranger on the street, that means you need to set the appropriate content filter setting. If you don't, your account will be moderated and possibly deleted by ViewFinder staff.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't show nudity in your buddy icon or cover photo.</h4>
      <p>
        Only content considered "safe" is appropriate for your icon or cover photo. If we find either contains inappropriate content, we'll remove it, mark your account as "restricted" and send you a warning. If we find you doing it again, we'll delete your account.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't upload content that is illegal or prohibited.</h4>
      <p>
        If we find you doing that, your account will be deleted and we'll take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to the authorities.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't vent your frustrations, rant, or bore the brains out of other members.</h4>
      <p>
        ViewFinder is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others. If we receive a valid complaint about your conduct, we'll send you a warning or delete your account.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't be creepy.</h4>
      <p>
        You know the guy. Don't be that guy.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't use your account to host web graphics or as a replacement for a content distribution network.</h4>
      <p>
        If we find you using your account to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos, banners, icons, and other non-photographic elements on other web sites, or if you show suspicious upload behavior that impacts the stability of our servers, we will warn you or delete your account.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don’t spam</h4>
      <p>
        We don't tolerate spam, deceptive tagging, deceptive photo titles and descriptions, resource abuse, or other abusive means to generate revenue and traffic to your photos on ViewFinder or elsewhere.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't use ViewFinder for unauthorized commercial activity.</h4>
      <p>
        We offer tools for the community to license their works to others; if interested, visit our Marketplace. ViewFinder generally supports photographer entrepreneurs big and small, but we don’t want to be a platform for your commercial activity or your business transactions, except for photos you enroll directly in our Marketplace.

        In your photo descriptions and on your profile page, you are welcome to link to your website or blog where you might also sell your work, but do not link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites, and don’t list prices on your ViewFinder photo descriptions.

        Your links need to be human readable (no shortened URLs) and they should be relevant to the photo, such as links to your website, to social media sites, or to your blog. Don’t turn your photo descriptions into link spam.
